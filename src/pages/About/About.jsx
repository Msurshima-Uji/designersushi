      <p className='aboutext'>This is my portfolio site. As a designer, I am all about designing the <br/> right product for people. My core value is "place the user first". Whatever design<br/> I create I want the client to feel and experience utmost satisfaction.</p> 
      <p className='aboutext'>I am also a seasonal front end developer so trust me, I understand collaboration <br/> to the socks and I am always ready to work with you and your team. This <br/> website contains a collection of some works of mine.</p>
      <p className='aboutext'>When I am not designing to work, you will find me reading a book or writing one<br/> or designing something that isn't work related. You could also catch me having<br/> a good time, I love a good reason to pop, with colours or without</p>
      <p className='final'>Don't let me distract your journey, explore further and contact me right after </p>
